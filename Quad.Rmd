## Quadratic Equations Explanation

This graph shows the different graphs possible of the quadratic equation. When a, b, and c are all 0, the quadratic equation graph will have a vertex at (0,0). When b=1, the graph becomes a line. When a=1, it becomes skinnier. When c=1, the graph becomes a horizontal line at y=1. When a and b are 1, the graph moves down and to the left. When b and c are 1, the graph becomes a line moved to the left. When a and c are 1, the graph moves up.
